Step 2 - clean up gen'd code, add singleton factory
===================================================

remove boilerplate unit tests generated by yeoman - read about karma and jasmine here http://www.tuesdaydeveloper.com/2013/06/angularjs-testing-with-karma-and-jasmine/)

ran

    yo angular:service espn
        generates stubbed out factory singleton in scripts/services/espn.js
        modifies index.html to include new script

manually modified scripts/controllers/main.js controller to use the new espn factory in the controller declaration - read https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di in scripts/services/espn.js I
    
    added $resource to the factory declaration
    created a 'resource' variable to defines how to call the espn 'now' api - http://developer.espn.com/docs/now . espn now does not take any parameters. In future steps I'll continue to modify scripts/services/espn.js to include calls that take parameters.
    added an espnnow() function which returns a angular $promise object instead of a callback - if you are unfamiliar with javascript promises checkout http://www.sitepoint.com/overview-javascript-promises/ not horrible - short version, make asyc js more readable and supportable by using promises

A few words about JSONP and why the resource takes these two objects {callback:'JSON_CALLBACK'},{get:{method:'JSONP'} -
    first what is JSONP
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP - basically it's a hack to work around the browsers cross domain js limitations and access REST apis.  CORS is probably a better option - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing - but JSONP works and espn's api support it.
    why did the angularjs guys use this syntax to make rest calls using JSONP? no idea, but these are the magic words to handle JSONP responses.

modified scripts/controllers/main.js to call espn.espnnow() when the controller is created.
    set a scope'd variable called espnnow when espn.espnnow() completes successfully. log errors
    modified the views/main.html template to display the headlines returned by espnnow()
